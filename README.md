# Town Registry
## Backend skill showcase
#### This is a server I'm building to showcase some of my backend development skills. It's a work in progress and I plan on updating it frequently.

###### This server handles registering citizens of a town and also information about towns to match them with. It uses springboot to accept information through API calls and backs up the data to MongoDB.
